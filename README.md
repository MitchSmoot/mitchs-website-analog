# MitchsWebsiteAnalog

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! It is being built on the SPARTAN stack, featuring Analog to create a full-stack, end to end type safe application. Initially, this will be a personal blog and portfolio website, and I will continue to add features related to my hobbies and favorite things.

## About the SPARTAN Stack

SPARTAN is an experimental tech stack for AnalogJS, with potential to become massively popular in the future!
The featured libraries are [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Analog](https://analogjs.org/),
[tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/),
and [Nx](https://nx.dev/).

My app does not currently use Tailwind, but I will probably add it soon.
