# MitchsWebsiteAnalog

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! It is being built on the new Analog meta-framework to create a full-stack, end to end type safe application. Initially, this will be a personal blog and portfolio website, and I will continue to add features related to my hobbies and favorite things. I will try to build things in the best way possible, so that other developers beginning their own Analog journey can use my code as a reference.

## Planned Additions

After the initial launch I hope to spice up the design with some creative three.js elements!
There will also be a travel page utilizing OpenStreetMap.
My hobby-related pages will continue to have useful information and tools added, in hope they will eventually become useful reference pages to those who share those hobbies.
