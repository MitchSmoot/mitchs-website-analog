      <p class="mitch-content-text">
        I was raised by thrill-seekers, and it has shaped me into the person I am today with a vast array of interests and experiences. Alongside my brother and twin, I have river rafted down the Grand Canyon river twice, At the age of 15, I received my Ham radio license and have since continued to higher levels. When I am not coding, you can find me underground exploring caves. I love being able to discover places no one has been before and pushing my limits to see how far I can go. I enjoy deep diving into different topics of interest to learn as much as I can and exploring new hobbies. If I don’t know something, I want to figure it out. Competitive cubing has become a passion and fidget of choice. As a two time national competitor, my fastest recorded time is 15 seconds. Also, I really like cheese and will do just about anything for it.
